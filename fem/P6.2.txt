P6.2
setup + solve problem 3.1 - conduction


TODO: in driver file
create equivalent to Bar1D file - but for 2D

graphs?



Completed:
create 9-node quadratic shape function
quadrature updated for 2d
preprocess.std_element_defs updated for quad2d
boundary conditions + other parms
implement 9-node quadratic elements




# to get gauss_legendre points, do one in xdim and one in ydim
# using Quadrature.gauss_legendre_1d(3)
