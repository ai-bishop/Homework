TODO

modify main_simpleBar.jl - coipied as P6.1.jl - to have the two element line be split into two sections?



implement basic conditions from HW6.1 - just force, all else already inputted

add 3node quad elements to Bar1D.jl - change types? what else?

Equilibrium in a spinning frame of reference - how do?
show f = ρAΩ^2 x - need defintiion
ρ = density
Ω = angular velocity
Derive analytical solution for displacements + stresses
Compare linear element results (for both displacements and stresses)
what do to match results exactly?
