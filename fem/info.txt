Problem 6.1: TODO

main_simpleBar.jl:
    COMPLETED - have the two element line be split into two sections? - completed???
    COMPLETED - implement force - changed, successful?
    COMPLETED - change forcing + mesh


Bar1D.jl
    COMPLETED - add 3node quad elements - change types? what else? - completed??
    COMPLETED - add quad rules to element_stiffness (like func after - in class deriv)
        COMPLETE - pass to assemble_stiffness

SimpleVisualization.jl
    COMPLETE - dbl check but i dont think so

Shapefunctions.jl
    COMPLETE - update shape functions to 3 note line

COMPLETE - Equilibrium in a spinning frame of reference - how do?



Derive analytical solution for displacements + stresses
Compare linear element results (for both displacements and stresses)
what do to match results exactly?
