Project:
A 2 dimensional plate.
make dimensions not have to be consistent
required: 
update quadrature.gauss_legendre2d(n) to have 2 inputs - x,y
create a Plate2D file based off of Bar1D
Create a visualization program - based off fo SimpleVisualations
Check existence of appropriate shape functions
use quadratic 9-node elements - 





Created GL3d for cubic structures
