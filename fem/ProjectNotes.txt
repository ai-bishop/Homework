Project:
A 2 dimensional square plate.

use quadratic 9-node elements - gauss_legendre_2dim

required: 

create a Plate2D file based off of Bar1D
Check plotting in SimpleVisualization - syntax in lines!, contour plots?



presentation
    show what done
    couple slides/static pictures




Completed:
update quadrature.gauss_legendre2d(n) to have 2 inputs - x,y
update visualization program
Check existence of appropriate shape functions
automated IEN creation
node locations automated
make dimensions not have to be consistent
added autocorrecting to make dimensions cooperate with quadratic 9node elements
do boundary condition creation
update IEN to correct indexing
completed main_simplePlate
